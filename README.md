# Vader Framework

Vader Framework is an open-source, modular toolkit for rapid development of modern, multiplatform applications with Dart/Flutter. 
It provides a robust foundation, code generation tools, design system utilities, and example projects to help developers build scalable, maintainable, and beautifully designed apps with ease.

## What is Vader Framework?

Vader Framework is designed to accelerate and standardize the development of Flutter applications. It offers:

- **Core libraries** for application logic, design systems, and CLI utilities.
- **Code generation tools** to automate repetitive tasks and scaffold new components or design structures.
- **Example projects** demonstrating best practices for frontend (Flutter) and backend (multiple technologies) integration.

## Key Features

- **Modular Architecture:** Includes core packages for app logic (`vader_core`, `vader_app`), design systems (`vader_design`), and CLI utilities (`vader_console`).
- **Code & Design Generators:** CLI tools (`code_builder`, `design_builder`) to automate code and design structure generation.
- **Example Implementations:** Ready-to-use example apps and design systems to help you get started quickly.
- **Backend Integration:** Sample backend services in various technologies (Node.js, Python, Dart, etc.) for full-stack development.

## Who is it for?

- Flutter developers seeking a solid foundation and best practices for new projects.
- Teams aiming to standardize and speed up their development workflow.
- Anyone looking for a comprehensive, extensible framework for building modern, cross-platform apps.
